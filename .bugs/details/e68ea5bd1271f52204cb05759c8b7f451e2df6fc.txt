After inserting updated rawdata into wpp_uprecsinfo in offline.updateAlgoData().

[expected]
the rawdata in wpp_uprecsinfo without loc info should be moved to another table like: wpp_uprecs_noloc, right before doClusterIncr().

[comment]
following sql executed for doClusterIncr() should be also modified for sqlwhere.
