[details]
1)tables tobe operated over-coupling with tables available;
2)Instance of class WppDB can NOT predict the name of the instance of the two wpp tables(wpp_clusteridaps,wpp_cfps).


[expected]
1)tables tobe operated tables_todo CAN be different from tables available tables_avail;
2)tbl_names={tablename:tableinstance,}, like {'wpp_clusteridaps':'wpp_clusteridaps_incr'}, thus in config.py, we can define the table field name & type format according to each table name.
