MUST
mod  Simplify mainly online arguments modification(discard those not for db).
fix  when online top4 RSS values correspond to more than 4 MACs.
add  ssid.py for mapping MACs and essid names.
mod  Modularize radio map related operation, like Fingerprint(), Cluster() (BECAREFUL:global vars!).
mod  minify number of global vars (cos it's slow).
mod  DB increamental upload support.
--------
add  Fingerprint clustering heuristic based on visible AP set for large scale radio map.
mod  Refine sort routine with both indices and elements returned (numpy.argsort()).
add  Summary information after radio map construction/online locationing.
add  Statistical chart or figure and data spreadsheet generation.
--------
mod  Refine WLAN RSS raw data collection method(syscall like pythonwifi).
opt  data structure and related operation.

MIGHT
mod  Functionalize online procedure.
mod  offline different key APs may correspond to same spid and physical address.
add  Filtering out unreliable raw-scanned APs for radiomap to have 10 APs left(rule: descending order rss or min-correlation).

LATER
add  OO support.
add  WLAN signal coverage level contour plot (referred to 'lewifi').
