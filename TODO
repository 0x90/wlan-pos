MUST
add  Fingerprint clustering heuristic based on visible AP set for large scale radio map.
mod  Sort routine with both indices and elements returned (numpy.argsort()).
add  spid:address description mapping.
add  Summary information after radio map construction.
add  Statistical chart or figure and data spreadsheet generation.
mod  Raw data collection method(syscall like pythonwifi) for WLAN, such as rss, etc.

MIGHT
add  Filtering out unreliable raw-scanned APs for radiomap to have 10 APs left(rule: descending order rss or min-correlation).

LATER
add  OO support.
