MUST
add  test module for online location fingerprinting(logging).
add  ssid.py for 1-1 mapping MAC and essid name.
mod  Modularize radio map related operation, like Fingerprint(), Cluster() (BECAREFUL:global vars!).
mod  Reduce the number of global vars (cos it's slow).
mod  Increamental DB table records upload.
--------
fix  when online top4 RSS values correspond to more than 4 MACs.
mod  Trunk: Probabilistic approach with 2 branches cloned: 1)GUI; 2)Profiling.
mod  Refine sort routine with both indices and elements returned (numpy.argsort()).
add  Summary information after radio map construction/online locationing.
add  Statistical chart or figure and data spreadsheet generation.
--------
mod  Refine WLAN RSS raw data collection method(syscall rewriten with Cython,SWIG,etc).
opt  data structure and related operation.

MIGHT
mod  Functionalize online procedure.
mod  offline different key APs may correspond to same spid and physical address.
add  Filtering out unreliable raw-scanned APs for radiomap to have 10 APs left(rule: descending order rss or min-correlation).

LATER
add  OO support.
add  WLAN signal coverage level contour plot (referred to 'lewifi').
