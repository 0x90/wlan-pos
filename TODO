MUST
add  Fingerprint clustering heuristic based on visible AP set for large scale radio map.
mod  Refine sort routine with both indices and elements returned (numpy.argsort()).
add  spid:address mapping configuration for indoor symbolic location.
add  Summary information after radio map construction/online locationing.
add  Statistical chart or figure and data spreadsheet generation.
mod  Raw data collection method(syscall like pythonwifi) for WLAN, such as rss, etc.

MIGHT
add  Filtering out unreliable raw-scanned APs for radiomap to have 10 APs left(rule: descending order rss or min-correlation).

LATER
add  OO support.
