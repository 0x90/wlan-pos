MUST
mod  rss_scan_dist built once enough(array(list*N).reshape()).
mod  split Radio Map related operation, like Fingerprint(), Cluster() (BECAREFUL:global vars!).
mod  minify number of global vars (cos it's slow).
fix  when online top4 RSS values correspond to more than 4 MACs.
fix  online visible MACs != key APs (pop weakest AP from wlan and use subset operation).
--------
add  Fingerprint clustering heuristic based on visible AP set for large scale radio map.
mod  Refine sort routine with both indices and elements returned (numpy.argsort()).
add  Summary information after radio map construction/online locationing.
add  Statistical chart or figure and data spreadsheet generation.
--------
mod  Refine WLAN RSS raw data collection method(syscall like pythonwifi).
opt  data structure and related operation.

MIGHT
add  Filtering out unreliable raw-scanned APs for radiomap to have 10 APs left(rule: descending order rss or min-correlation).

LATER
add  OO support.
